# env-development [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/azu/env-development.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/azu/env-development)

Set $NODE_ENV to "development".

Works best with `mocha --require env-development`.

## Why?

Because to force environment, I was used to add `process.env.NODE_ENV = "development"` at the beginning of every file.

Because relying on `Makefile` or `package.json` to set this environment is almost always OK, but when one user just throws `mocha` in his terminal we don't want to punish him with data loss or any other hell.

Whereas relying on `mocha.opts` makes it easy (no more ugly line in each test file) and reliable (always loaded).

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    npm install env-development

## Usage

### With mocha

- Install with `npm install --save-dev env-development`
- Edit `test/mocha.opts` and add the line `--requir env-development`
